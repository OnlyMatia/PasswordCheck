  <h1>Secrets</h1>
  <ul>
    <li><u>Superman</u> - In a calculated move, a skilled marksman aims a specially crafted Kryptonite bullet at Superman, exploiting his vulnerability to the mineral. As the bullet pierces his skin, the toxic effects weaken the Man of Steel, diminishing his strength and resilience, leaving him susceptible to further attacks.</li>
    <li><u>Flash</u> - In a cunning confrontation, a villain strategically plants a wrist bomb on The Flash, calibrated to detonate when his speed drops below a certain threshold. As The Flash races against time to save the day, the relentless monitoring system ensures that any attempt to reduce his speed becomes a perilous gamble, setting the stage for a high-stakes battle against the ticking clock.
    <li><u>Wonderwoman</u> - A nefarious adversary, seeking to exploit Wonder Woman's compassion, clandestinely implants microchips in her brain, distorting her perception to see all people as the relentless adversary Cheetah. Unaware of the manipulation, Wonder Woman valiantly battles what she believes to be a ceaseless threat, leading to an emotionally and physically draining conflict that pushes her to the brink until her heart succumbs to exhaustion.
    <li><u>Martian Manhunter</u> - A cunning foe administers a potent poison to Martian Manhunter, designed to permeate his skin and become highly flammable. Helplessly aflame, the usually formidable hero finds himself unable to extinguish the fire, facing an inescapable demise as the toxic substance courses through his alien physiology, leaving him vulnerable to the lethal effects of the insidious concoction.
    <li><u>Batman</u> - Faced with the united strength of the Justice League, Batman's unparalleled strategic mind and formidable combat skills prove insufficient against the combined powers of his superhuman allies. Overwhelmed by their collective force, the League exploits every weakness and tactic, leaving Batman with no choice but to concede to the superior might of his comrades, resulting in his ultimate defeat.</li>
